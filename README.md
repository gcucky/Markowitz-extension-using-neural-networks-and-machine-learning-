Is it possible to build a financial portfolio that gives higher returns by harnessing the power of neural networks and machine learning? 

Let's imagine that we have to build a financial portfolio, this means having to buy different amounts of shares and then effectively allocate our capital to be able to earn as much as possible while keeping under control the risk that this involves (or the opposite :) ).

Having to build this portfolio on 1/1/2019 using the Markowitz model what we will do is a simple comparison between the portfolio choice given by the returns on 1/1/2019 and the same returns with the addition of a forecast via RNN and Random Forest of 10 days. 

We will then obtain two optimal allocations of the Markowitz model and we will see that the portfolio built with the addition of the yield forecasts outperforms the one with only the historical returns, an indication that we are adding quality information capable of improving the return on our investment.
